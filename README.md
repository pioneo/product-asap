# ASaP-IDE



## Requirements
 - Java 8 or newer (Note that a full JDK needs to be installed, not just a JRE).
 - The current version of the ASaP-IDE is based on an 64-bit Eclipse, so it's recommended to install a 64-bit JDK.
 - For more information on basic Eclipse installation issues, visit [Eclipsepedia - the Eclipse.org Wiki] (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/Installation). 

## Installation

First, download the ASaP-IDE via clicking the download buttons on top of the page. The download will be delivered as compressed (i.e. a "zip", or ".tar.gz" file. Decompress this file into the directory of your choice (e.g. "c:\asap" on Windows) and ensure you have full Read and Execute permissions. You can optionally create a shortcut of the executable file ("asap.exe" on Windows, or "asap" on Mac).
