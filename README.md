# ASaP-IDE

The ASaP-IDE is an Eclipse-based full-featured Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing generic Smart Services based on the [Agent-based Smart Service Platform (ASaP)](https://publikationen.sulb.uni-saarland.de/handle/20.500.11880/25477). 

## Requirements
 - Java 8 or newer (Note that a full JDK needs to be installed, not just a JRE).
 - The current version of the ASaP-IDE is based on an 64-bit Eclipse, so it's recommended to install a 64-bit JDK.

## Installation

First, download the ASaP-IDE via clicking the download buttons on top of the page. 

The download will be delivered as compressed (i.e. a "zip", or ".tar.gz" file. Decompress this file into the directory of your choice (e.g. "c:\asap" on Windows) and ensure you have full Read and Execute permissions. You can optionally create a shortcut of the executable file ("asap.exe" on Windows, or "asap" on Mac).

```
project

│   file001.txt

└───folder1
│   │   file011.txt
│   │   file012.txt
│   │
│   └───subfolder1
│       │   file111.txt
│       │   file112.txt
│       │   ...
│   
└───folder2
    │   file021.txt
    │   file022.txt
```

Note that there is a known problem with the built-in decompression utility on all current versions of Windows. We recommend that you use a more robust decompression utility such as the open source [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) when decompressing an Eclipse download. Some people report success when initially decompressing and Eclipse-based application into a root directory (e.g. c:\) and then moving it to a more appropriate home (e.g. c:\Program Files\ASaP).
